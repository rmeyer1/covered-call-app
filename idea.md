### Question 
Help me help me come up with a strategy or a plan for the optimal solution to continue to generate income on my AMD shares but also conservative enough that I'm not giving a large amount of upside in exchange for premium. In the screenshot, you can see I wrote these call options when the stock was around $184. So it's obviously been going down and i am making money. I actually think AMD is kind of in a bear lag situation, so I think the stock could go down a little bit further. I'd like to write calls every month out of the money to generate income and be conservative with the strikes . Help me come up with a plan of what I should do now with these calls.


### Current Position Assessment
Your short AMD $200 call (expiring 9/12/2025) is deeply out-of-the-money with the stock at $162.33 and only about 14 days remaining. The option's current price of $0.10 reflects a very low probability of it finishing in-the-money, especially given your bearish outlook on AMD potentially declining further. You've already captured most of the $4.15 credit as profit, and the remaining time value is minimal.

**Recommended action now:** Let the call expire worthless on 9/12. This allows you to keep the full $415 premium (per contract, before any fees) without incurring transaction costs to buy it back. Buying it back now for $0.10 would lock in $405 profit but isn't necessary unless you want to immediately free up the shares for a new trade— the risk of a sudden rally above $200 in the next two weeks is negligible based on current market data and your view.

If you prefer to act sooner (e.g., to roll into a new position), buy back the call for around $0.10 and proceed to sell a new one as outlined below. Either way, the net impact is similar given the low remaining value.

### Ongoing Conservative Covered Call Strategy
Since you own AMD shares and want to generate monthly income via options while being conservative—meaning prioritizing retention of upside potential over maximizing premium—focus on selling out-of-the-money (OTM) calls with strikes well above the current price. This reduces the likelihood of assignment (getting your shares called away) and allows the stock more room to appreciate if your bearish view shifts.

The goal is to collect steady premium (income) while accepting that lower-risk strikes yield smaller premiums. Based on your previous trade (selling the $200 strike when AMD was ~$184, about 8.7% OTM), we'll aim for similar or slightly more conservative positioning (10-20% OTM) to limit upside capping. Given your bearish lag expectation, this strikes a balance: you benefit from premium if the stock stays flat or declines, but aren't overly aggressive.

#### Key Principles for the Strategy
- **Frequency:** Write a new call roughly every month, targeting 30-45 days to expiration for a good theta (time decay) profile without excessive commitment.
- **Strike Selection:** Conservative = 10-20% OTM based on the current stock price. This corresponds to deltas of ~0.1-0.3 (probability of finishing ITM around 10-30%), minimizing assignment risk.
  - Adjust dynamically: If AMD drops (as you anticipate), lower the % OTM to maintain income without chasing risk.
  - Avoid ITM or ATM strikes—they offer higher premium but cap upside more aggressively, which contradicts your conservative goal.
- **Premium Expectation:** Expect 1-3% monthly yield on the stock price (annualized 12-36%, but variable with volatility). Don't chase >3% as it typically requires tighter strikes.
- **Risk Management:**
  - Monitor weekly: If the stock rises toward your strike (e.g., delta >0.5), consider rolling the call "up and out" (buy back and sell a higher strike/further expiration) to preserve upside.
  - If AMD declines significantly, the call expires worthless—reducing your cost basis via premium—and you can sell the next one at a lower strike.
  - Position sizing: Stick to 1 contract per 100 shares to keep it simple and aligned with your current setup.
  - Exit rules: Let most expire, but close early if profit >80% of max (e.g., buy back if premium drops to 20% of credit received).
- **Overall Outlook Fit:** This is ideal for your bearish view—downside keeps shares + premium, flat generates income, mild upside still profits until the strike. If AMD rallies big, you cap gains but at a high level (conservative strikes).
- **Account Considerations:** In a Roth IRA, all income is tax-free, making this efficient for long-term holding.

#### Specific Plan Starting After 9/12 Expiration
Once your current call expires, immediately sell a new OTM call for the next monthly expiration: October 17, 2025 (~49 days out, but treat as your "monthly" cycle). Use current market data (stock ~$162.33, IV ~42%) to select:

- **10% OTM (~$178 strike, closest available 180):** 
  - Expected credit: ~$3.90 (bid/ask midpoint).
  - Delta: ~0.29 (29% chance ITM).
  - Breakeven: $183.90 (strike + premium).
  - Yield: ~2.4% over 49 days (annualized ~18%).
  - Why? Decent income if bearish, but caps upside at $180—moderate conservatism.

- **15% OTM (~$186 strike, closest 185):**
  - Expected credit: ~$2.91.
  - Delta: ~0.23 (23% chance ITM).
  - Breakeven: $187.91.
  - Yield: ~1.8% over 49 days (annualized ~13%).
  - Why? Balances your original trade's aggressiveness with more upside room—recommended starting point for conservatism.

- **20% OTM (~$195 strike):**
  - Expected credit: ~$1.66.
  - Delta: ~0.14 (14% chance ITM).
  - Breakeven: $196.66.
  - Yield: ~1.0% over 49 days (annualized ~7.5%).
  - Why? Very conservative—allows significant upside (stock could rise 20% without assignment) but lower income. Ideal if your bearishness strengthens.

**My Recommendation:** Start with the 15% OTM (185 strike) for ~$2.91 credit. It's conservative enough to give ~14% upside room (vs. your original ~9%) while providing meaningful income (~$291 per contract). This aligns with not "giving a large amount of upside" for premium—if AMD drops or stays flat, you pocket it; if it rises moderately, you keep gains up to $185 + $2.91 effective.

#### Monthly Roll Process
1. **Post-Expiration (e.g., after 10/17):** Assess AMD's price and your outlook.
2. **Update Strike:** Recalculate 10-20% OTM based on new price (e.g., if AMD falls to $150, 15% OTM = ~$172.50).
3. **Sell New Call:** Target next monthly (November ~45 days out). Use similar delta check.
4. **Adapt if Needed:**
   - More bearish? Go 20%+ OTM for safety.
   - Volatility spike? Premiums rise—good for income.
   - Bullish turn? Pause or choose 25% OTM.
5. **Track Performance:** Aim for 1-2% average monthly premium. Over time, this compounds to lower your share cost basis (e.g., $4.15 already reduced it by that amount).

This plan generates consistent income (~$200-400/month per contract at these levels) while keeping risk low. Re-evaluate quarterly based on AMD fundamentals (e.g., earnings, market trends). If you provide updated screenshots or price changes, I can refine specifics.

###Follow up
How do I turn this call writing strategy into a web app where I can load my eligible stocks into it or manually add stocks I own 100+ shares in and pull the options chain and figure out what price to write calls every month. Use reactJS/Vite for the front end. If building a backend id prefer nodeJS or NextJS however, if an optimal solution involves using a python backend id be open to it as I have experience but would want to learn more about the solution first.

###Answer
To turn your covered call writing strategy into a web app, we'll build a simple full-stack application. It will allow you to manually add stocks (with validation for 100+ shares), list your eligible stocks (those with >=100 shares), fetch options chains for them, and suggest conservative OTM call strikes (10%, 15%, 20% OTM) for the next monthly expiration (~30-45 days out). The suggestions will include estimated premiums, deltas, and yields based on real market data.

I'll use React with Vite for the frontend (as specified) and Node.js with Express for the backend (preferred over Next.js for a clear separation, but you can adapt to Next.js if you want server-side rendering). This avoids Python unless necessary—no strong reason here, as Node handles API proxying and logic well.

### Key Choices and Assumptions
- **Data Source**: We'll use Finnhub's free API for options chains and quotes (endpoint: `/stock/option-chain?symbol={ticker}`). It has a generous free tier (60 calls/min), supports options data, and is easy to integrate. Sign up at finnhub.io for a free API key (no credit card needed).
  - Response format: JSON with `calls` and `puts` arrays per expiration date, including strikes, bids, asks, deltas, etc.
  - Alternatives: If Finnhub limits hit, switch to Polygon.io (free tier: 5 calls/min; endpoint: `/v3/snapshot/options/{ticker}` with filters).
- **Storage**: For simplicity, use browser localStorage to store your stocks (ticker + shares). No backend DB needed for a personal app—avoids setup overhead. If you want persistence across devices, add MongoDB later.
- **Strategy Logic**: In the backend (to hide API key), fetch current price (`/quote?symbol={ticker}`), options chain, filter for next expiration (closest to +35 days), then suggest closest OTM calls at 10/15/20% above current price. Calculate yield as (premium / current) * (365 / days_to_exp) annualized.
- **Security**: Backend proxies API calls to hide your Finnhub key (don't expose it in frontend).
- **Limitations**: Free APIs may have delays or limits; for production, consider paid tiers. No auth yet—add if sharing.
- **Deployment**: Host frontend on Vercel/Netlify, backend on Render/Heroku (free tiers).

### Step 1: Sign Up for Finnhub API
- Go to finnhub.io, create a free account, and get your API key (e.g., `c123abc`).
- Test it: In browser, visit `https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=AMD&token=YOUR_KEY`—should return JSON with current price.

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend (Node.js/Express)
Create a Node.js server to handle API proxying and strategy calculations.

1. Create a folder `backend` and init: `mkdir backend && cd backend && npm init -y`.
2. Install deps: `npm install express axios cors dotenv date-fns`.
3. Create `.env` with `FINNHUB_KEY=your_key_here`.
4. Create `server.js`:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const cors = require('cors');
const { addDays, differenceInDays, parseISO, closestTo } = require('date-fns');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

const FINNHUB_BASE = 'https://finnhub.io/api/v1';
const TOKEN = process.env.FINNHUB_KEY;

// Fetch current quote
async function getQuote(ticker) {
  const res = await axios.get(`${FINNHUB_BASE}/quote?symbol=${ticker}&token=${TOKEN}`);
  return res.data.c; // Current price
}

// Fetch options chain
async function getOptionsChain(ticker) {
  const res = await axios.get(`${FINNHUB_BASE}/stock/option-chain?symbol=${ticker}&token=${TOKEN}`);
  return res.data.data; // Array of expirations with calls/puts
}

// Endpoint: Get suggestions for a ticker
app.get('/api/suggestions/:ticker', async (req, res) => {
  const { ticker } = req.params;
  try {
    const currentPrice = await getQuote(ticker);
    const chain = await getOptionsChain(ticker);

    // Find next monthly exp (~30-45 days out)
    const today = new Date();
    const targetDate = addDays(today, 35); // Aim for ~35 days
    const expDates = chain.map(exp => parseISO(exp.expirationDate));
    const nextExp = closestTo(targetDate, expDates.filter(d => d > today));
    const daysToExp = differenceInDays(nextExp, today);

    // Filter calls for that exp
    const calls = chain.find(exp => exp.expirationDate === nextExp.toISOString().split('T')[0]).calls;

    // Suggest 10%, 15%, 20% OTM
    const suggestions = [1.10, 1.15, 1.20].map(otmFactor => {
      const targetStrike = Math.round(currentPrice * otmFactor / 5) * 5; // Closest multiple of 5
      const closestCall = calls.reduce((prev, curr) =>
        Math.abs(curr.strike - targetStrike) < Math.abs(prev.strike - targetStrike) ? curr : prev
      );
      const premium = (closestCall.bid + closestCall.ask) / 2; // Midpoint
      const yieldMonthly = (premium / currentPrice) * 100;
      const yieldAnnualized = yieldMonthly * (365 / daysToExp);

      return {
        otmPercent: (otmFactor - 1) * 100,
        strike: closestCall.strike,
        premium,
        delta: closestCall.delta,
        yieldMonthly: yieldMonthly.toFixed(2),
        yieldAnnualized: yieldAnnualized.toFixed(2),
        expiration: nextExp.toISOString().split('T')[0],
      };
    });

    res.json({ currentPrice, suggestions });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```
5. Run: `node server.js`. Test at `http://localhost:5000/api/suggestions/AMD`—should return JSON with suggestions.

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (React/Vite)
1. Create: `npx create-vite@latest frontend --template react`.
2. cd `frontend` && `npm install axios react-hook-form` (for forms).
3. In `src/App.jsx`, build the UI:
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

function App() {
  const [stocks, setStocks] = useState([]);
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState({});
  const { register, handleSubmit, reset } = useForm();

  useEffect(() => {
    const saved = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('stocks')) || [];
    setStocks(saved.filter(s => s.shares >= 100)); // Eligible only
  }, []);

  const saveStocks = (newStocks) => {
    localStorage.setItem('stocks', JSON.stringify(newStocks));
    setStocks(newStocks.filter(s => s.shares >= 100));
  };

  const onAddStock = (data) => {
    if (data.shares < 100) return alert('Must own 100+ shares');
    const newStocks = [...stocks, data];
    saveStocks(newStocks);
    reset();
  };

  const getSuggestions = async (ticker) => {
    const res = await axios.get(`http://localhost:5000/api/suggestions/${ticker}`);
    setSuggestions(prev => ({ ...prev, [ticker]: res.data }));
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '20px' }}>
      <h1>Covered Call Strategy App</h1>
      
      {/* Add Stock Form */}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onAddStock)}>
        <input {...register('ticker')} placeholder="Ticker (e.g., AMD)" required />
        <input {...register('shares', { valueAsNumber: true })} placeholder="Shares (100+)" type="number" required />
        <button type="submit">Add Stock</button>
      </form>
      
      {/* Stock List */}
      <ul>
        {stocks.map(stock => (
          <li key={stock.ticker}>
            {stock.ticker} ({stock.shares} shares)
            <button onClick={() => getSuggestions(stock.ticker)}>Get Suggestions</button>
            {suggestions[stock.ticker] && (
              <div>
                <p>Current Price: ${suggestions[stock.ticker].currentPrice}</p>
                <table>
                  <thead><tr><th>OTM %</th><th>Strike</th><th>Premium</th><th>Delta</th><th>Monthly Yield %</th><th>Annualized %</th><th>Exp</th></tr></thead>
                  <tbody>
                    {suggestions[stock.ticker].suggestions.map(s => (
                      <tr key={s.otmPercent}>
                        <td>{s.otmPercent}</td><td>{s.strike}</td><td>${s.premium}</td><td>{s.delta}</td>
                        <td>{s.yieldMonthly}</td><td>{s.yieldAnnualized}</td><td>{s.expiration}</td>
                      </tr>
                    ))}
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
            )}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
4. Run: `npm run dev`. Visit `http://localhost:5173`. Add stocks, click for suggestions (backend must be running).

### Step 4: Enhancements and Deployment
- **Polish**: Add loading states, error handling, CSS (e.g., Tailwind via `npm install -D tailwindcss`).
- **Monthly Automation**: Add a cron job in backend (with node-cron) to email suggestions monthly, but that's advanced.
- **Switch to Python Backend**: If preferred (e.g., for data analysis), use Flask: `pip install flask requests python-dotenv dateutil`. Similar structure—endpoint fetches Finnhub, computes suggestions.
- **Deployment**:
  - Backend: Push to GitHub, deploy on Render (free). Set env var for key.
  - Frontend: Deploy on Vercel. Update API URLs to your backend URL.
- **Costs/Scaling**: Free for personal use. If hits limits, upgrade Finnhub ($25/mo for more calls) or use Polygon.

This gives a functional MVP. Test with AMD—add it, get suggestions. Expand as needed (e.g., load from brokerage CSV). If stuck, provide errors for troubleshooting. Remember, this is not financial advice—use at your own risk.


###Follow Up 
Let’s figure out the framework piece. Is NextJS a viable alternative to NodeJS/Express for the server side functionality needed ?

###Answer 
Yes, **Next.js** is a viable alternative to **Node.js with Express** for the server-side functionality required for your covered call strategy web app. Both can handle the backend needs—API proxying to fetch options chain data (e.g., from Polygon.io), processing to suggest OTM strikes, and serving responses to your React/Vite frontend. However, they differ in architecture, features, and use case fit. Let’s compare them based on your requirements (fetching real-time data, hiding API keys, computing strategy suggestions) and provide guidance on adapting the solution.

### Comparison: Next.js vs. Node.js/Express

#### 1. Architecture and Purpose
- **Node.js with Express**:
  - **What it is**: A minimal runtime (Node.js) paired with a lightweight web framework (Express) to build a custom REST API server.
  - **How it works**: You define routes (e.g., `/api/suggestions/:ticker`) and handle requests with middleware, manually managing server setup and deployment.
  - **Fit for your app**: Ideal for a standalone API server that proxies Finnhub/Polygon calls and runs strategy logic (e.g., OTM strike calculation).

- **Next.js**:
  - **What it is**: A React framework that extends Node.js with built-in server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, all bundled into one project.
  - **How it works**: Combines frontend (React) and backend (API routes under `pages/api/`) in a single app. API routes are serverless functions (e.g., Vercel-hosted) that run on demand, handling requests without a persistent server.
  - **Fit for your app**: Suitable if you want to merge frontend and backend into one codebase, leveraging Next.js’s deployment simplicity and built-in features.

#### 2. Pros and Cons

##### Node.js with Express
- **Pros**:
  - **Control**: Full control over server setup, middleware (e.g., CORS), and routing.
  - **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead (~20 MB dependencies) for a single-purpose API.
  - **Flexibility**: Easy to scale with additional endpoints or connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB) later.
  - **Familiarity**: Matches your preference for Node.js and aligns with the existing backend sketch.
- **Cons**:
  - **Setup Overhead**: Requires manual server configuration (e.g., port binding, error handling) and separate deployment (e.g., Render).
  - **Deployment Complexity**: Needs a Node.js runtime environment, increasing hosting costs or effort (free tiers on Render/Heroku).
  - **No Built-in Frontend**: Requires a separate React/Vite app, adding coordination.

##### Next.js
- **Pros**:
  - **Unified Codebase**: Combines React frontend and API backend in one project, simplifying development and deployment.
  - **Serverless**: API routes run as serverless functions (e.g., on Vercel), auto-scaling and eliminating persistent server management.
  - **Ease of Deployment**: One-click deploy to Vercel (free tier), with automatic scaling and environment variables (e.g., for Polygon API key).
  - **Built-in Features**: Includes SSR, static export options, and middleware (e.g., CORS via `next.config.js`), reducing boilerplate.
  - **TypeScript Support**: Enhances code quality, which could be useful as your app grows.
- **Cons**:
  - **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding Next.js-specific concepts (e.g., API routes, `getServerSideProps`) if you’re new to it.
  - **Overhead**: Adds framework weight (~50 MB dependencies) compared to Express, though this is mitigated by serverless execution.
  - **Less Control**: API routes are stateless and event-driven, which might limit custom server logic (e.g., WebSocket for real-time updates).
  - **Vercel Dependency**: Optimized for Vercel; other hosts (e.g., Render) require more configuration.

#### 3. Suitability for Your Use Case
- **Requirements**:
  - Fetch options chain data via API (e.g., Polygon.io).
  - Hide API key (requires server-side handling).
  - Compute OTM strike suggestions (10-15-20%) and return JSON.
  - Serve to React/Vite frontend.
- **Node.js with Express**:
  - Meets all needs with the existing `/api/suggestions/:ticker` endpoint. The backend proxies requests, processes data, and responds—perfect for your current plan.
  - Separate frontend (Vite) requires CORS setup, but that’s manageable.
- **Next.js**:
  - Also meets all needs by moving the API logic to `pages/api/suggestions/[ticker].js`. The frontend can be rewritten in Next.js (replacing Vite) or kept separate with API calls to the same domain.
  - Hides the API key in serverless functions, and Vercel’s environment variables simplify key management.
  - Computation (e.g., strike selection) fits within API route handlers.

#### 4. Performance and Scalability
- **Node.js with Express**: Runs on a persistent server, good for low-latency responses if traffic is steady. Scales with a load balancer or more instances, but free tiers may limit concurrency.
- **Next.js**: Serverless functions scale automatically with demand (e.g., Vercel handles spikes), but cold starts (initial load delay) may occur with infrequent use. For your app (personal use, few stocks), this is negligible.

#### 5. Development and Maintenance
- **Node.js with Express**: Faster to set up with your existing code, but requires separate frontend sync (e.g., matching API changes).
- **Next.js**: Slower initial setup (converting Vite to Next or integrating), but long-term maintenance is easier with a unified app. Hot reloading and TypeScript support enhance productivity.

### Recommendation
**Next.js is a viable and preferable alternative** for your project, especially given your openness to it and the following advantages:
- **Simplified Workflow**: Combining frontend and backend in one Next.js app (e.g., rewrite Vite as a Next project) reduces coordination. If you prefer keeping Vite, Next’s API routes still work as a backend.
- **Deployment Ease**: Vercel’s free tier handles both, avoiding separate server hosting. This aligns with your personal app focus.
- **Future-Proofing**: As you add features (e.g., user auth, historical data charts), Next.js’s ecosystem (e.g., middleware, SSR) is more adaptable than Express.

However, if you value speed of implementation and already have the Express backend working, stick with it initially—migrate to Next.js later.

### Adapting to Next.js
#### Step 1: Set Up Next.js
1. Create a Next.js app: `npx create-next-app@latest covered-call-app --ts` (TypeScript for robustness).
2. Install dependencies: `npm install axios date-fns`.

#### Step 2: Create API Route
In `pages/api/suggestions/[ticker].js`:
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import { addDays, differenceInDays, parseISO, closestTo } from 'date-fns';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { ticker } = req.query;
  if (!ticker) return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Ticker required' });

  try {
    const currentPrice = (await axios.get(`https://api.polygon.io/v3/quote?symbol=${ticker}&apiKey=${process.env.POLYGON_KEY}`)).data.lastSalePrice;
    const chain = (await axios.get(`https://api.polygon.io/v3/snapshot/options/${ticker}?apiKey=${process.env.POLYGON_KEY}`)).data.options;

    const today = new Date();
    const targetDate = addDays(today, 35);
    const expDates = chain.map(o => parseISO(o.expirationDate));
    const nextExp = closestTo(targetDate, expDates.filter(d => d > today));
    const daysToExp = differenceInDays(nextExp, today);

    const calls = chain.filter(o => o.expirationDate === nextExp.toISOString().split('T')[0] && o.side === 'call');
    const suggestions = [1.10, 1.15, 1.20].map(otmFactor => {
      const targetStrike = Math.round(currentPrice * otmFactor / 5) * 5;
      const closestCall = calls.reduce((prev, curr) =>
        Math.abs(curr.strike - targetStrike) < Math.abs(prev.strike - targetStrike) ? curr : prev
      );
      const premium = (closestCall.bid + closestCall.ask) / 2;
      const yieldMonthly = (premium / currentPrice) * 100;
      const yieldAnnualized = yieldMonthly * (365 / daysToExp);

      return {
        otmPercent: (otmFactor - 1) * 100,
        strike: closestCall.strike,
        premium,
        delta: closestCall.delta,
        yieldMonthly: yieldMonthly.toFixed(2),
        yieldAnnualized: yieldAnnualized.toFixed(2),
        expiration: nextExp.toISOString().split('T')[0],
      };
    });

    res.status(200).json({ currentPrice, suggestions });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
}
```
- Add `POLYGON_KEY` to `.env.local`: `POLYGON_KEY=your_key_here`.
- Note: Polygon’s API differs from Finnhub—adjust parsing (e.g., `options` array structure).

#### Step 3: Frontend
- Rewrite `App.jsx` as a Next page (`pages/index.js`):
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Home() {
  const [stocks, setStocks] = useState([]);
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    const saved = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('stocks')) || [];
    setStocks(saved.filter(s => s.shares >= 100));
  }, []);

  const saveStocks = (newStocks) => {
    localStorage.setItem('stocks', JSON.stringify(newStocks));
    setStocks(newStocks.filter(s => s.shares >= 100));
  };

  const onAddStock = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const ticker = e.target.ticker.value;
    const shares = Number(e.target.shares.value);
    if (shares < 100) return alert('Must own 100+ shares');
    saveStocks([...stocks, { ticker, shares }]);
    e.target.reset();

- `fetch` uses relative paths, leveraging Next.js’s API routing.

#### Step 4: Deploy
- Push to GitHub, connect to Vercel, and deploy. Vercel auto-configures environment variables from `.env.local`.

### Conclusion
Next.js is not only viable but advantageous for your app, offering a seamless frontend-backend integration and deployment simplicity. Start with it if you’re willing to learn its basics (e.g., API routes)—the transition from Vite is straightforward. If you prefer sticking with Express for now, it’s fine; migrate later as needed. Test the Next.js setup with AMD and let me know if you encounter issues!
