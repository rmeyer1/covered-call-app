This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Playwright UI Testing and MCP Server

This repo includes Playwright for E2E tests and a Playwright MCP server for agent-driven UI testing.

- Install deps and browsers: `npm ci && npx playwright install`
- Run tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Start MCP server: `npm run mcp:playwright`

Notes
- MCP client config lives at `.mcp/servers.json` (server key: `playwright`).
- The server targets `http://localhost:3000`. Ensure `npm run dev` is running or adjust the `--baseURL` flag.
